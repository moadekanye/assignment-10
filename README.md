In this project, I applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and compare four texts (Text_1.txt, Text_2.txt, Text_3.txt, and Text_4.txt). Using Python libraries like spaCy and NLTK, I performed tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract key information, determine the subject of each text, and identify common themes. I also implemented n-gram analysis (n=3) to compare the trigrams in Text_4.txt with those in the first three texts, trying to determine if any of the authors of the first three texts might have written the fourth one based on stylistic similarities. The methods focus on generating common tokens, identifying named entities, and examining the frequency of trigrams, providing a straightforward approach for text comparison and subject inference. While this approach is effective for basic analysis, it does have limitations, such as relying on simple heuristics for subject detection and text preprocessing
